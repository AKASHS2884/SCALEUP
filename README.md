AI-Powered Quantum Drug Discovery

Dear Coordinators,  

Due to the extensive API configurations, including AutoDock and Maltapp DeepFold, the project size exceeds 500MB, making it unfeasible to push directly to GitHub. Therefore, I am uploading only the Regression Model (CNN & GNN), Prediction Model, and **Confusion Matrix assessing drug effectiveness, alongside a comparison of Traditional vs. Quantum Redemption.  

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at the designated venue.

Overview  
Our system integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Computing to revolutionize pharmaceutical research. By significantly reducing the time and cost involved in drug discovery, this innovative approach enhances precision and efficiency in identifying effective treatments.  

Why It Matters? 
- Traditional drug discovery can take 10+ years and cost billions.  
- Over 90% of experimental drugs fail in clinical trials.  
- AI and Quantum Computing enable faster, cost-efficient, and personalized treatments**.
